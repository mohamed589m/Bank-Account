# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## ðŸ“‘Project description: 

INSTRUCTIONS / CONSIDERATIONS:

1. Let's implement a simple bank account! It's similar to the example that I used as an analogy to explain how useReducer works, but it's simplified (we're not using account numbers here)

2. Use a reducer to model the following state transitions: openAccount, deposit, withdraw, requestLoan, payLoan, closeAccount. Use the `initialState` below to get started.

3. All operations (expect for opening account) can only be performed if isActive is true. If it's not, just return the original state object. You can check this right at the beginning of the reducer

4. When the account is opened, isActive is set to true. There is also a minimum deposit amount of 500 to open an account (which means that the balance will start at 500)

5. Customer can only request a loan if there is no loan yet. If that condition is met, the requested amount will be registered in the 'loan' state, and it will be added to the balance. If the condition is not met, just return the current state

6. When the customer pays the loan, the opposite happens: the money is taken from the balance, and the 'loan' will get back to 0. This can lead to negative balances, but that's no problem, because the customer can't close their account now (see next point)

7. Customer can only close an account if there is no loan, AND if the balance is zero. If this condition is not met, just return the state. If the condition is met, the account is deactivated and all money is withdrawn. The account basically gets back to the initial state
